# Encrypter-Decrypter

This project is an Encryptor-Decryptor which was done in collaboation with my friend Lakshanya. It can encrypt and decrypt the given messages and the ciphers thorugh Morse code, Caesar cipher, Qwerty cipher, Reverse cipher and Transposition cipher. We get the input for Morse code, Qwerty cipher and Reverse cipher while for Transposition cipher and Caesar cipher we get the offset value as well. We have used the following modules and packages to implement our project:

1. tkinter
2. caesarcipher
3. qwerty
4. transpositionCipher
5. reverseCipher
6. morseCipher
